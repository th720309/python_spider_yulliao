			What Is Physical Abuse Of A Nursing Home Resident?		</td><td>
        Physical abuse is the same regardless of age or location of the recipient of the abuse. However, when seniors are abused it is felt as an outrage because they are less able to defend themselves physically. Answer by Dr. Bonnie Lynn Wright, PhDEven more so when that abuse happens in a residence that should be keeping them safe and healthy and are being paid to do so. One word of caution, if you hear hoof beats, think horses not zebras unless you are in the Serengeti. If you go to visit Mom or Dad and they have a bruise, don't immediately think abuse. They may have a bruise from bumping into something on the way to the bathroom or from some medication they are taking. Always inquire about any signs or verbal reports of injuries but don't judge the source until you get those answers. Nursing home abuse can come from staff members, visitors, or other residents. The reasons may be due to very long-standing psychological or medical problems, such as dementia, if a resident is involved. For others, it may be the power and control cycle. Additionally, seniors in a home are easily overpowered and controlled by someone for who that dynamic is important. Regardless of the reasons for the assault or the status of the perpetrator, abuse is never acceptable. It must be reported and thoroughly investigated. Nursing homes should have policies and procedures in place for this purpose and all staff members should be familiar with them. Steps must be taken to protect those who cannot protect themselves.   ANSWERS FROM MORE EXPERTS                      Anthony Cirillo   Physical abuse causes a body injury, physical pain, or impairment to a nursing home resident.

			What Is Abuse?		</td><td>
        Abuse is a term used to describe the mistreatment of a person. A person can be abused by another person physically or emotionally. It is important to note that the victims do not cause the abuse. Abusers are responsible for their actions, even if they are under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. However, these substances may make the abuse worse. Answer by Natural StandardDomestic abuse: Domestic abuse typically occurs when an individual emotionally, verbally, or physically mistreats his/her spouse or intimate partner. However, victims may also include children and/or other family members. In some cases, abusers may also mistreat family pets. When the abuser inflicts physical harm onto the victim, it is called domestic violence. Domestic violence, which is considered a crime, is the most common cause of injury to women ages 15 to 44. In severe cases, domestic abuse can lead to murder. Individuals who are being abused are advised to leave their relationships. Abuse survivors are encouraged to seek the help of a friend, family member, or support group. Staff at emergency shelters can help victims file for court-ordered protection from the abuser, if necessary. If the abuser seeks treatment, including counseling, he/she may be able to change his/her behavior. However, the victim should avoid contact with the abuser until the abuser has received treatment and has shown that he/she is no longer abusive. Victims are also encouraged to seek counseling. Sexual abuse: Sexual abuse occurs when an individual engages in any activity that is sexual in nature against the will of someone else. This may include exposing genitalia, touching or feeling individuals in an uncomfortable way, as well as vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Individuals who sexually abuse others are commonly called sexual predators. Children may be sexually abused by a friend, neighbor, caregiver, teacher, stranger, or family member, including a parent, stepparent, aunt/uncle, or sibling. The abuser is usually older than the victim and he/she intimidates the victim into engaging in sexual activities. When children are sexually abused, it is often called molestation. Adults who sexually abuse children are called pedophiles. You should read product labels, and discuss all therapies with a qualified healthcare provider.

			Can Men Be Victims of Mental Abuse?		</td><td>
        Yes, they can. Traditionally, men in North America, at least, have been raised to see themselves as providers, protectors, leaders and pillars of the community. Since WWII and women's entry into the labor force that perspective has slowly been eroded.  Answer by Bonnie Lynn Wright, PhDThe economic environment has also been cycling through periods of distress that make it close to impossible for any one person to be 'the provider' for a family.  Within that context, we can understand that men may feel less confident in their social and family roles, whether they express that dissonance outwardly or not. That may help to create susceptibility to mental abuse. If added to the above context, a boy may have been raised in a family where there was emotional abuse as a normal way of functioning within the family. Without role models that demonstrate more kindness and equality between family members, the boy's susceptibility for being a victim of mental abuse will increase even more. As a society, we also systemically mentally abuse minorities; by color, creed, disability, gender, etc. In my opinion, this too adds to the susceptibility of individuals to be abused by others. It sets up an expectation of inferiority/superiority in all relationships rather than equality and mutual respect. --This content was originally published on Sharecare.com.
